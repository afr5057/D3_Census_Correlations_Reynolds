          <h4>Obesity</h4>
          There does not appear to be a correlation with poverty and obesity.
          The bulk of obese individuals in the United States have a median age between 34 - 42.
          Median Household income does seem to affect obesity rates. As the median household income increases,
          the prevalence of obesity narrows. In Texas, there seems to be a strong correlation between obesity 31.9%
          and lacking healthcare 24.9%.

          <h4>Smoking</h4>
          The median age for smokers is between 36 and 44 and among households with a median household income
          between $45K and $60k though an incline is noticed within prevalence of smokers in lower income households.
          There does not seem to be a connection between smoking and healthcare except in Massachusetts where only
          4.6% of the population is without healthcare and only 14.7% are smokers. The inverse is Louisiana where
          18.7% lack healthcare while 24% are smokers.<br>

          <h4>Healthcare</h4>
          There did not seem to be a correlation with poverty and the lack of healthcare in 2014. The bulk
          of population that is lacking healthcare is between the median age of 36 and 42. There seems to be a
          correlation between healthcare and median household income where the higher the median household income,
          the less percentage of population without healthcare.<br><br>
